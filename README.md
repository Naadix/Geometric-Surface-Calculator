# Geometric Surface Calculator
Functional Requirements :
## 1. User Interface :
o Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing (or another
library of your choice).
o The interface must allow the user to select the geometric shape
that he wishes to calculate.
o Appropriate input fields must be displayed depending on the form
selected so that the user enters the necessary dimensions (e.g. radius
for the circle, length and width for the rectangle).

## 2. Calculation of Areas :
o Circle: Calculation of the area using the formula π × r2, where r is the radius.
o Square: Calculation of the area with the formula side2.
o Rectangle: Calculation of the area with the formula length × width.
o Equilateral triangle: Area from the formula (√3 / 4) × side2.
o Other Shapes (optional): You can propose surfaces of other
geometric shapes, such as the trapezoid or the rhombus.

## 3. Display of Results :
o Once the dimensions have been entered, the program must calculate and display the
result of the surface in a result area.

## 4. Checks and error messages :
o Make sure that the program validates the user entries (e.g.: no
negative or non-numeric values).
o If an incorrect value is entered, display an appropriate error message.
